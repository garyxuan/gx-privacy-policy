    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Last updated: 2025-12-04 · Applies to PhotoCleanup for iOS/iPadOS</div>

    <p>We value your privacy and data security. This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>PhotoCleanup</strong> ("the App") handles your information. The core functionality is to help you review and clean up photos/videos on your device.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App <strong>does not collect</strong> personally identifiable information, does not create user accounts, and does not store your media on any developer server.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photo/Video Library</strong>: Accessed <strong>on-device only</strong> to display and clean up content. Media files are not uploaded to any developer server.</li>
      <li><strong>Media Metadata</strong>: e.g., creation date, favorites flag, media type, used locally for sorting, filtering, and cleanup decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>1.1 Advertising Service Data</h3>
    <p>The App integrates <strong>Google AdMob</strong> advertising service to display ads. AdMob may collect the following data to provide advertising services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Identifiers</strong>: Including advertising identifier (IDFA, only if you grant permission), device model, operating system version, etc., used for ad delivery and performance analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising Interaction Data</strong>: Including ad impressions, clicks, conversions, and other interaction information, used to optimize ad content and performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Including app usage patterns, feature usage frequency, etc., used for analytics and service improvement.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics Data</strong>: Including crash logs, performance data, etc., used to improve app stability.</li>
      <li><strong>Network Information</strong>: Including IP address, network type, etc., used for ad delivery and content optimization.</li>
      <li><strong>Approximate Location Information</strong>: General geographic location inferred from IP address, used to provide relevant ad content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected and processed by Google AdMob for advertising services, ad attribution, and fraud prevention purposes. This data <strong>is not used to identify you personally</strong> and is not linked to your photo library content.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <strong>Important:</strong> Unless iCloud is involved by the OS or by your choice (subject to Apple’s terms), the App does not transmit your media or personal data off your device.
    </div>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photos (Read/Write)</strong>: Required to read the system Photos library for displaying/filtering and to perform operations like delete/favorite/add to album. You can manage permissions anytime in System Settings.</li>
      <li><strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong>: Used to access the advertising identifier (IDFA) so that AdMob can provide personalized ads and perform ad attribution. This permission is optional, and you can disable it anytime in System Settings. The App will function normally even if you deny this permission, though ads may be less personalized.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Processing & Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All media processing is performed <strong>on-device</strong>.</li>
      <li>Deletion actions use system Photos APIs and follow the system’s Recently Deleted and permanent deletion mechanisms.</li>
      <li>No cloud copies are created by the App, and your media is not shared with third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third Parties & Sharing</h2>
    <p>The App integrates <strong>Google AdMob</strong> advertising service. The following explains data sharing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: The App uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect the advertising service data described above (see Section 1.1), which is collected and processed by Google for advertising services, ad attribution, and fraud prevention purposes. For Google's privacy policy, please refer to: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Photo/Video Library Content</strong>: The App <strong>does not</strong> share your photo library content, photos, or videos with any third party, including AdMob. All media content is processed locally on your device and is not uploaded to any server.</li>
      <li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>: The App does not share any personally identifiable information with third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>Because the App does not transmit or store your media on servers, your data primarily benefits from the security of your device and its operating system. We recommend enabling device passcode/biometrics and OS security features.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may change or revoke Photos access in System Settings at any time.</li>
      <li>You may manage advertising tracking permissions in System Settings (Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking) to choose whether to allow the App to track your activity.</li>
      <li>You can delete or favorite items within the App; all changes are performed via system Photos APIs.</li>
      <li>Regarding AdMob data collection, you can manage it through Google's privacy settings: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com/</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
